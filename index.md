We get enthusiastic about...

You might enjoy [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/chapter/1), which is a treatise on all these subjects, packaged as a Harry Potter fanfiction for ease of consumption.

Our group also has a lot of overlap with
  [Seattle Effective Altruists](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SeattleEffectiveAltruists/)
  and
  [Seattle MIRIx](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SeattleMIRIx/):
  though effective altruism and AI research aren't inextricable from rationality, <em>de facto</em> many rationalists are passionate about those things as well.


## Want to meet up?
Do you like this kind of stuff? If yes, you should attend our weekly reading group! Each week, we read a few blog posts or articles about the above topics, and get together to discuss them on Monday evening. See [our calendar](/calendar) for information about the upcoming meetings.

After reading group, most of us go to a rationalist house in Madison Park, where dinner is generously provided, and we spend a few hours eating and chatting and playing board games.
