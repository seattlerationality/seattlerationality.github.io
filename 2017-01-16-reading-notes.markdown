Why Nerds are Unpopular
-----------------------

In high school, being smart seems to make kinds unpopular. Why?

In particular, why don't they make themselves popular, if they're so smart?

Probable answer: they don't really want to be popular. At least, they don't want it as badly as they want to be smart. So they devote lots of resources to getting smarter instead of populer. And in such an environment with such fierce competition for status, you can't afford to do that. If you don't devote all your resources to the status game, you end up on the bottom.

In short: nerds are unpopular because they're focusing on other things.

Around 11 years old, kids start treating their family as a day job: what *really* matters to them is their peers. And the world they create for themselves is <em>Lord of the Flies</em>.

Why is this? Why, in high school, is to be unpopular to be **persecuted**? Adults don't persecute nerds; why high schoolers? In part, because they're children, and children don't yet have consciences; in part, because you gain status by pushing others down; and in part, because popularity is about alliances, and nothing builds alliances like an enemy. If you don't have an enemy, you can create one. (Supporting evidence: the worst bullying happens from groups, not individuals.)

Also: the most popular kids don't persecute nerds. They don't need to. The low-status kids, *they're* the ones who need to show they're better than the lowest-status ones.

-------------------

Adults know, in an abstract sense, that kids are monstrously cruel to each other. But they don't dwell on it, the same way you (probably) don't dwell on the world's other injustices. They're like prison wardens: incentivized to keep the inmates from *really* crossing the lines, but mostly just leaving them to build their <em>Lord of the Flies</em> society.

-------------------

Why is the real world better for nerds?

Because adults are too mature to pick on each other? Unlikely: adults in prison pick on each other, as do society wives.

More likely, it's because in the real world, what you do has *real effects.* It's harder to float on a raft made of lower-status people, and easier to float because *you built a raft.*

Also, the real world is big: tiny minorities (like nerds) can clump together, interact mostly with their ingroup. (Sometimes nerds even exaggerate their awkwardness to gain status within the tribe.)

-------------------

Suburbs are breeding areas, and their schools holding pens.

-------------------

Adults see that kids are tormented, but they blame it on hormones.

But it's not hormones: you don't see records of nihilist pubescents in Mongol tribes or Renaissance time. Therefore, kids' torment is probably due to the suburban-school environment they're put in.

Teenagers used to be more respected, because they were useful. Now, they're not able to do useful work: they're in the way. So they're gathered into one place and some guards set to watch over them. Again, like prison inmates.

-------------------

In the real world, when people organize into a hierarchy, it's usually for a purpose, and the leaders end up being the best at it. Schools have no purpose, so their hierarchy is organized around... nothing.

When there's some meaningful test of skill, it's not painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie football player *aspires* to be as good as the veteran, and the veteran might feel some <em>noblesse oblige</em>. And they already have an enemy: the other team. They don't need to push each other down.

This is the cause of school life's cruelty and boredom: purposelessness.

-------------------

The current awful school environment has mostly come about by default. Adults are busy, and don't spend the time or energy to fight back the bureaucracy.

The important thing for nerds to understand is that they aren't losers, just playing a different game. School isn't real life; it's a strange, artificial thing.
