[Why Nerds are Unpopular](http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html)
-----------------------------------------------------------

In high school, being smart seems to make kinds unpopular. Why?

In particular, why don't they make themselves popular, if they're so smart?

Probable answer: they don't really want to be popular. At least, they don't want it as badly as they want to be smart. So they devote lots of resources to getting smarter instead of populer. And in such an environment with such fierce competition for status, you can't afford to do that. If you don't devote all your resources to the status game, you end up on the bottom.

In short: nerds are unpopular because they're focusing on other things.

Around 11 years old, kids start treating their family as a day job: what *really* matters to them is their peers. And the world they create for themselves is <em>Lord of the Flies</em>.

Why is this? Why, in high school, is to be unpopular to be **persecuted**? Adults don't persecute nerds; why high schoolers? In part, because they're children, and children don't yet have consciences; in part, because you gain status by pushing others down; and in part, because popularity is about alliances, and nothing builds alliances like an enemy. If you don't have an enemy, you can create one. (Supporting evidence: the worst bullying happens from groups, not individuals.)

Also: the most popular kids don't persecute nerds. They don't need to. The low-status kids, *they're* the ones who need to show they're better than the lowest-status ones.

-------------------

Adults know, in an abstract sense, that kids are monstrously cruel to each other. But they don't dwell on it, the same way you (probably) don't dwell on the world's other injustices. They're like prison wardens: incentivized to keep the inmates from *really* crossing the lines, but mostly just leaving them to build their <em>Lord of the Flies</em> society.

-------------------

Why is the real world better for nerds?

Because adults are too mature to pick on each other? Unlikely: adults in prison pick on each other, as do society wives.

More likely, it's because in the real world, what you do has *real effects.* It's harder to float on a raft made of lower-status people, and easier to float because *you built a raft.*

Also, the real world is big: tiny minorities (like nerds) can clump together, interact mostly with their ingroup. (Sometimes nerds even exaggerate their awkwardness to gain status within the tribe.)

-------------------

Suburbs are breeding areas, and their schools holding pens.

-------------------

Adults see that kids are tormented, but they blame it on hormones.

But it's not hormones: you don't see records of nihilist pubescents in Mongol tribes or Renaissance time. Therefore, kids' torment is probably due to the suburban-school environment they're put in.

Teenagers used to be more respected, because they were useful. Now, they're not able to do useful work: they're in the way. So they're gathered into one place and some guards set to watch over them. Again, like prison inmates.

-------------------

In the real world, when people organize into a hierarchy, it's usually for a purpose, and the leaders end up being the best at it. Schools have no purpose, so their hierarchy is organized around... nothing.

When there's some meaningful test of skill, it's not painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy. A rookie football player *aspires* to be as good as the veteran, and the veteran might feel some <em>noblesse oblige</em>. And they already have an enemy: the other team. They don't need to push each other down.

This is the cause of school life's cruelty and boredom: purposelessness.

-------------------

The current awful school environment has mostly come about by default. Adults are busy, and don't spend the time or energy to fight back the bureaucracy.

The important thing for nerds to understand is that they aren't losers, just playing a different game. School isn't real life; it's a strange, artificial thing.



[What You'll Wish You'd Known](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<em>(This was meant to be a high school graduation speech, but the administration vetoed the plan to invite him.)</em>

In high school, you don't have to know what you're going to do with your life. Adults just ask that to get a sense of who you are.

Your first priority should be to get a sense of what the options are. And even more than that-- the world changes quickly, and a lot of today's jobs didn't exist ten years ago. The usual advice of **"don't give up on your dreams"** sucks, because you shouldn't be bound by your current dreams.

**"Don't think you can't do what other people can"** is better, but still wrong. There's some variation in natural ability (although, if there are two explanations in apparent ability, and one of them excuses your laziness, the other one's probably right). You don't know the limits of your abilities, so... how is this helpful?

How about: **"stay upwind."** When you're on a glider, you want to stay upwind of any good landing spots; when you're deciding what to do with your life, stay upwind of good opportunities.

But how are you supposed to tell what good opportunities are? It's hard to tell whether literary theory or math is upwind of the other, because they're both incomprehensible until you get deep into them.

The best protection is working on hard problems. Do things that make you worry you'll do badly.

So: **"work on hard problems."** This doesn't just mean doing well in school: treat school as a day job, avoid wasting time. (You might call time-wasting "hanging out" or "playing" -- well, it's like chocolate cake. Don't *never* do it, but don't do a lot of it.) Extracurriculars also aren't always hard: fundraising for a charity is easy, programming and writing and drawing faces from life are hard.

Treating school as a day job doesn't mean you should rebel. It still matters, and even if you rebel you're being defined by what you're told to do.

School might make you think that doing great things requires lots of discipline. Not so. Lots of people who do great work have little discipline, procrastinate, ignore emails. If you want to do good work, you need a great curiosity for a promising question.

It can be really hard to find a promising question.

You need to find a question that makes the world interesting. To do this, just, say, put in a month of work on a project that interests you and will stretch you. Don't worry if it doesn't seem to be on the path to a goal, but avoid models that excuse laziness.

Go out and learn, actively. This involves finding good books.

The only real difference between adults and high school kids is that adults realize they need to get things done, and high school kids don't. Get to work.
